# helper macros for using surrealdb

the goals of this crate are described in this [github issue](https://github.com/AnthonyMichaelTDM/mecomp/issues/6)

it will likely not be feature complete, since I only need it for this project, but the eventual goal is to basically have a sqlx type library for surrealdb
